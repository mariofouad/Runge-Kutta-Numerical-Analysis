# Overview
Numerical Analysis is the branch of mathematics that is about approximate computing. It tells you how quickly you can get and how close you are to the true solution. It is beneficial for scientists and engineers. Many techniques and approaches were examined, and each has its advantages and drawbacks.
# Objective
This was the project of the "Numerical Analysis" course at Cairo University, Computer Engineering Department. This project aims to learn another method for solving second-order differential equations 
and construct a program to solve it.
# How To Run
Using Visual Studio:
1. Download all files on your local machine.
2. Open the "code" folder.
3. Press on Run button on the top left of F5 on the keyboard.
# How To Use
1. Enter the start value for x.
2. Enter the end value for x.
3. Finally, enter the step size.
